# Daily-Mail-Sender
Daily mail sender project for my wife
This project is using a very well known News website's api to obtain daily headlines about my wife's favourite football team.
using pythonanywhere.com's free cloud service this sends her all the links to all relevant articles.
if anyone wants to use this just replace the different variables to better suit your needs and change the "q" in the parameters to 
obtain information about the query you want.

thanks and I hope this helps you!
